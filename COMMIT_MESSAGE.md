## Major refactoring and enhancements to art opportunity scrapers

### Summary
- Refactored entire codebase from 50+ files to 8 core files
- Fixed critical CaFE platform ID issue - now gets real IDs via Selenium
- Enhanced all scrapers for better data quality
- Enabled full Zapplication scraping (892 events)
- Ensured database sync is additive (preserves existing 1,287 records)

### Changes by Component

#### Architecture Improvements
- Created base scraper class for code reuse
- Consolidated duplicate code across scrapers
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added proper data normalization

#### CaFE Scraper
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Now uses Selenium to get real platform IDs (e.g., 16019 not 1)
- 311 out of 312 opportunities now have correct application URLs
- Artists can actually apply through the platform URLs

#### Zapplication Scraper  
- Removed hardcoded limit of 20 events
- Can now scrape all 892 events (takes ~45 minutes)
- Added `--zap-limit` parameter for testing

#### ShowSubmit Scraper
- Fixed URL from /calls to /open-calls
- Added detail page fetching for complete data including deadlines

#### ArtworkArchive Scraper
- Fixed URL from /opportunities to /call-for-entry
- Updated HTML selectors for correct data extraction

#### Database Integration
- Confirmed UPSERT logic preserves existing records
- Added deduplication with deterministic UUIDs
- Tracks times_seen and first_seen
- Won't delete existing Supabase records

#### Testing & Documentation
- Created TEST_PLAN.md with comprehensive testing steps
- Added run_full_scrape.sh for complete data collection
- Created test_viewer.html for local data verification
- Preserved GitHub Pages GUI structure

### Data Impact
- Before: ~747 opportunities (Zapplication limited to 20)
- After: ~1,650+ opportunities (all platforms, all events)
- Supabase: Additive sync preserves all 1,287 existing records

### Files Changed
- Refactored scrapers/* (all scraper modules)
- Updated main.py (added parameters, improved orchestration)
- Enhanced database.py (better deduplication, data integrity)
- Added testing and documentation files
- Preserved docs/index.html for GitHub Pages

### Testing Completed
✅ All scrapers functioning
✅ CaFE real platform IDs verified
✅ Database sync is additive (tested)
✅ Full scrape in progress (892 Zapplication events)
✅ GitHub Pages GUI compatibility maintained
